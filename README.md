# 42 Piscine 🏊‍♂️💻

Welcome to the 42 Piscine repository! This collection contains exercises that are retries of the exercises I completed during the 42 Piscine. 

## About 📖

These exercises were developed after the Piscine in an attempt to sharpen my C programming skills before diving into the core curriculum. While they are based on the original Piscine exercises, some may be a bit more sophisticated than the ones I completed earlier in the program.

## Disclaimer ⚠️

- These exercises were **never checked against Moulinette** (the automated grading system), only mini moulinette (the non official tester).
- Some exercises **might not be Norminette compliant** (the coding style checker for 42).
- Please **use this repository with a grain of salt**. While I have put effort into these exercises, they may contain mistakes or areas for improvement.

## Structure 📁

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to different sets of exercises. Each directory contains the source files for the exercises in that set.

## Usage 🚀

Feel free to browse through the exercises and use them as a reference. If you spot any issues or have suggestions for improvements, contributions are welcome!

Happy coding! 😊
